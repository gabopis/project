        <b>Why is it important to spread awareness?</b><br><br>
        The role of education in fire safety in the residential environment is, thus, extremely important because, in the end, people make the difference. Technical fire safety is, of course, very important but it is people who have to safely use the equipment and products, who have to close fire doors, and who have to respond to a smoke detector in case of a fire breaking out, etc. The social dimension of fire safety is therefore not to be underestimated.</p>

			Smoke detectors are your first line of defense against fire because of their early warning capability. These days, theyâ€™re hardwired into homes to monitor smoke and carbon monoxide, and send alerts to your smart devices.</td>

			<td><b>Make sure all heating sources work efficiently</b><br><br> The National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) says heating equipment is the top cause of fire in American homes. The thing is, faulty heating sources like space heaters, central heating systems, and fireplaces could trigger a fire when ignored or left unchecked. So an annual professional checkup is necessary to keep them working safely and optimally.</td>

			<td><b>Do regular maintenance on oven</b><br><br>
			Your cooking may not be to blame if your stove suddenly combusts. Instead, the food particles that have accumulated at the bottom of the burner could likely be the culprit. The same thing can happen if you forget to clean the buildup in your oven. Now that you know what could happen to forgotten food sitting on these kitchen appliances, make sure to clean them every after use.</td>

			<td><b>Take caution with cords around the house</b><br><br>
			There are several angles to look at when it comes to cords. First off, make sure to check if there are too many appliances plugged into an outlet, which can cause it to overload. If this is the case, you should immediately lessen the load and keep things manageable for each of your outlets.</td>
